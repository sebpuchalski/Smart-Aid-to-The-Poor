# Smart-Aid-to-The-Poor

Smart Aid Distribution to the Poor
Having aid money isn't enough. Aid is effective only when the delivered to the right people. 
So, it is critical to be able to know who to deliver the aid to.

In this kernel I do just that: I will analyze the data provided by the Inter-American Development Bank 
to build a model that can classify a Costa Rican household with respect to the experienced poverty level.

To make the project more interesting I added monetary cost/benefit structure to reward models that are 
best at identifying households affected by povery as opposed to households that are not.
